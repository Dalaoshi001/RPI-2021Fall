A relational database
-------------------------

Database = a set of relations

Data model: 

Each relation has a set of attributes

Each attribute has a domain: a set of valid values

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Database: SIS

Relations: Students, Courses, Classes, Grades, FinancialInfo, Faculty

Attributes:

    Classes: Section, Course Code, Subject Code, CRN, Classroom, MaxEnrollment, Format, Semester, Year
    
    Students: First, Middle, Last, Pronouns, Preferred Name, RIN, SSN, Address, email, flex balance

Domain of an attribute: set of valid values:

Course Code: 4 digit code, Subject Code: 4 letters, CRN:5 digits
RIN: 9 digits start with 66

A database is a set of relations.

A database instance is a set of tuples in each relation such that each
tuple satisfy the data model rules.

Relations -------  Tables
Attributes  ------ Columns
Tuples    -------- Rows

--------------

Rule 1: A relation instance is a set of tuples. [[tuples are not repeated!]]

{1,1,2,3,4} == {1,2,3,4} == {2,3,4,1}


Rule 2: All attributes are simple, contain flat, atomic values.


Key of a relation: A key for a relation is a minimal set of attributes
such that no two tuples can have the same values for the key.

Students: First, Middle, Last, Pronouns, Preferred Name, RIN, SSN,
          Address, email, flex balance

          Key: RIN
