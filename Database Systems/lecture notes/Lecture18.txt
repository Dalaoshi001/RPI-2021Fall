Hard disk types:
--------

Magnetic, cheap
SSD - solid state, expensive

ioping:
------------
us -> microseconds, 1/1 000 000
ms -> miliseconds, 1 / 1 000

Magnetic Disk access:

Reading a portion of the disk: 
	Seek time (move the disk head)
	+ Rotational Latency (more or less fixed)
	+ Data transfter time (getting faster with denser disks)

A page: A single unit of data I can read



Terms:
-----------

Disk/Platter

Surfaces

Tracks

Cylinder

Sectors

Pages -> Block [8K]

Disk page address:  Surface - Track - Sector

Meta-verse: Data unit center no + Trailer no + Computer No + Hard disk No + Surface - Track - Sector

----------------------

Seek time: 4ms (approx)

Rotational latency:  60 000 / (2 *72 00) = 4.17 ms

Transfer time: (number of consecutive pages) * transfer time (0.03 ms/page)

Cost to read 100 random pages: 100 * (6.46 + 4.17 + 0.03) = 1000 ms

Cost to read 100 sequential pages: 6.46 + 4.17 + 100 * 0.03 = 13 ms


So far
----------
- Hard disk slow(compare to stuff you do in memory)
- Reading many pages sequentially is good (better than random I/O)
- Must read into memory any page to do anything
- Unit of read/write: a disk page (or a memory block)
- Cost of query: number of pages
- An index is a loop up structure
   - index is stored in memory
   - index is on a specific attribute (or attributes)
   - index can be multilevel
   - cost of query depends on how the index matches the query


What is the cost of answering this query?
-----------------------------------------------

select count(*) from playedonradio where station = 'mai';

- Cost: number of pages I have to read to answer this query

- Sequential scan: read every page the 'playedonradio' is stored in and 
  check for station and increment the counter

x

-- Create an index on playedonradio(station)

Each index entry: key value (station) and pointer to a tuple


e.g create index station_idx on playedonradio(station);

- Index only scan for 

select count(*) from playedonradio where station = 'mai';

	- Read all pages for the index until the end of station 'mai';

select count(distinct songid) from playedonradio where station = 'mai';

 - Read all index pages to find all tuples for station = 'mai'
   + Read all found tuples to find songids
