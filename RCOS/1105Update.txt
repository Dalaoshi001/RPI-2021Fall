Status Update
Project Meetup

This week:
Working on setting up the whole environment, try to get connection between backend and frontend.
Since my redis has been collapsed, still trying reinstall my redis. Also, Write serveal comments to my code
to make them more readable. Keep studying springboot's relevant configuration. Finish writing python
to make more convenient for teammates to get the link from git.

Next week:
Continue studying Springboot's relevant configuration and trying to install stable version of redis. Maybe
write more comments in my code and prepare for the final presentation.

Block:
There is currently no block there.
