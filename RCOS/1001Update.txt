Project Meetup

This week:
Help classify our Springboot into model, Dao, Mapper, Controller, Service,
and finisihed our setup for the database. Write example code for modify
appointment, building in the database. Continued studying Springboot
and we finially decide to write python to clean our appointment database
every 24 hours and export it as sql file. In this way, we will save our database
space.

Next week:
We will still talk about the design of database and start trying to get access
to the front-end team to implement at least some functions with them. I will
also continue to study Springboot for our project.

Block:
Time is limited, I also need to prepare for my test, which is really bad :(
I hope to get free from test as early as possible.
