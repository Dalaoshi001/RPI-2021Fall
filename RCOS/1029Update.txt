Status Update
Project Meetup

This week:
After finishing most of the back-end work, we have some meeting to talk about our results and work
so far, still try to learn new things to modify our project better. In this week, we successfully set up the
nacos environment in our computer. Help front-end team to access our API successfully in their computer.


Next week:
Plan to modify our strucutre and add comments, even decide to modify our 
database and systems to improve the efficiency. Maybe write comments for our API
more clearly, and add new function to improve our efficiency and functions.

Block:
There is currently no block there.
