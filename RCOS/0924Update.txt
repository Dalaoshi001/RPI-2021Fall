This Week:
Study Springboot in bilibili, help modify structure of database.
For database, we took long time to make sure its in BCNF structure.
We decide to utilize mysql and setup the configuration in springboot
backend. Test and make sure our configuration in springboot can work
successfully by using postman to run. I keep communication with my project
manager. We have many conversions and after conversation, we decide to utilize
two sepearate repos for front-end and back-end. For studying springboot, I know
the basic concepts about component, autowired, basic web requests and even the
auto configration function in springboot. I will keep continuing study in this when
I doing my work.

Next Week:
Continuing studying springboot, especailly for database, add, delete, update and select
four basic operations. And we may modify our database in the future.  I also plan to keep
communication with front-end to know their basic requirments for back-end API.
