Status Update
Project Meetup

This week:
Write an interface which will generate qrcode with given URL. Also,
comment many codes to make it clear for front-end team. Trying
to add more data to test to make sure our code works well in the
database. Try to solve the problem with token, headers and even
domain name.

Next week:
Keep communication with the front-end team. Continue studying
springboot. Actually, I belive our back-end team's work is almost
done!

Block:
There is currently no block there.
